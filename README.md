The main idea for this project is to create a comprehensive task manager 
application using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in Python. 
The application allows users to create tasks, organize them into categories, 
assign tasks to themselves or others, and track the status and due dates of 
tasks. Users can also view tasks based on various criteria such as status, due 
date, assignee, and category. The task manager provides functionality to add, 
remove, update, and display tasks, as well as manage users. This project aims 
to provide a user-friendly and efficient tool for managing tasks and increasing 
productivity
